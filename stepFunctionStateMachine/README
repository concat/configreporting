This directory details the StepFunction State Machine for the automated Compliance Reporting.

Steps include:

1) Cloud Watch Event to periodically trigger
2) A Lamdba function which fires off the StateMachine based on the ARN of that SM
3) The SM which invokes pullComplianceData (Python function), generateReport (Node function), and sendEmailwithAttachment (Python function)
