This directory details the StepFunction State Machine for the automated Compliance Reporting.

UPDATE - 1/18/18

CloudWatch Events Rules can now directly start a Step Functions State Machine;
thus the flow is

1) CloudWatch Event periodically triggers a Step Functions State Machine
2) The State Machine which invokes pullComplianceData (Python function), two parallel branches to generateReport (branch 1) and generateReportXLS (branch 2) (Node functions), and a final sendEmailwithAttachment (Python function)

===
Previous flow retained here for comparison - do not implement
Steps include:

1) Cloud Watch Event to periodically trigger a Lambda Function..
2) startStepFunctionsStateMachine, a Lambda function which fires off the StateMachine based on the ARN of that SM
3) The State Machine which invokes pullComplianceData (Python function), generateReport (Node function), and sendEmailwithAttachment (Python function)

Details on 1 - Step on a CloudWatch event to trigger at either crontab-based or interval based schedule

Details on 2 - 
Console:

FunctionName is: startStepFunctionsStateMachine
Runtime is: Node.js 6.10
File is: index.js
Handler is: index.handler

IAM Role is a basic one with addition of to execute StepFunctions 
Create the IAM role as "Create A Role", name it per instructions in "iam" directory but don't select any of the provided templates - leave this selection blank! Then after the function is created, add an inline policy to permit executing a state machine per iam doc in "iam" directory.

Environment variable: STATEMACHINE_ARN - the arn of the StateMachine to start
