This directory contains the framework needed to build/modify report definitions used ultimately by generateReport Lambda node function.

Place designer.html and index.html on your favorite Linux Apache webserver, along with the bucket-report-def-pdf.json and bucket-report-def-xls.json, and the resourcescompliancetorulesschema.json file. Pull the data file resourcescompliancetorules.json from the S3 bucket where it is placed by pullComplianceData Lambda function.

Load http://<yourwebserver>/designer.html to see the current report design.
Modify it as you like and capture the json produced at the bottom of the page when you click "Save". Replace the current "bucket-report-def-pdf.json" with this content and refresh to confirm your changes to the report format are there.

You can produce output by using the index.html which will actually generate the report in the browser for you.

When you are satisfied with this format, upload it onto the production S3 bucket at the path specified in the environment configuration as shown at REPORT_DEF.

This same process can be followed for the xls formats.
